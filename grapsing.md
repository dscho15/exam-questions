Question:

Definition of a grasp (focus on) 
- Disturbance, how to maintain a grasp, closure grasp.
- Definition of a point contact

Answer:

- A mathematical model of grasping is one way of definining a grasp, we resort to two model-types form closure and force closure. They are defined as follows:

1) Form closure if it is impossible to move the object, even infinitesimally, relatively to the grasping device.

2) Force closure is similar to form closure, but relaxed to allow frictional forces to help balance the object wrench.

3) In general, it is desirable to maintain contact, between the object and the grasping device, i.e., no seperation and no unwanted sliding.

4) It is desirable to feedback linearize disturbance forces, i.e., inertia (in case of fast motion) or gravity induced forces.

5) To model force and velocity transmissions, between object and grasping device, we need to model the contact points, usually done by a tangential plane and a normal vector. Three models are considered here: PCWF, HF and SF.

- Grasp maintenance means that the contact forces applied by the hand prevents contact seperation and unwanted contact sliding.

- A closure grasp is defined as a class of grasps that can be maintained for every possible disturbance load.

- A contact point is considered as two coincident points; one on the hand and one on the object.
